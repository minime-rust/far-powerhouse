# ‚ö° FAR Powerhouse - Rust Server Plugins ‚ö°

Welcome to the **FAR Powerhouse**, the central repository for custom plugins used on our **FAR Rust servers**! This is where we share the tools and enhancements that make our Rust server experience unique and enjoyable.

## üëã About FAR Powerhouse

Our journey started in 2023 with a passion for Rust and running dedicated game servers. We've experienced the challenges of maintaining plugins, adapting to game updates, and navigating the often-stifling support landscape. The FAR Powerhouse is our way of giving back to the community, sharing solutions to common problems, and fostering a collaborative environment for Rust server owners and players.

Here, you'll find a collection of plugins that have been developed, tested, and fine-tuned specifically for our servers, addressing various gameplay elements, server management, and quality-of-life improvements. We believe in transparency, continuous improvement, and the power of community-driven development.

## üöÄ Our Plugins

This repository hosts a growing collection of plugins. Each plugin resides in its own dedicated folder and comes with its own `README.md` file, detailing its specific features, installation instructions, configuration options, and commands.

## ü§ñ Developed with AI Assistance

Transparency is important to us. It's crucial to mention that most of the plugins within this repository have been developed with significant assistance from AI tools. This includes leveraging AI for:

*   Scanning for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Ensuring null-safety and robust error handling.
*   Identifying and mitigating memory leaks.
*   Optimizing methods to reduce system resource usage.
*   Suggesting alternative approaches and boilerplate code.

Every line of code, regardless of its origin, is thoroughly reviewed, understood, and tested by us. We stand behind the quality and safety of every single plugin published here. Our goal is to use the best available tools to deliver high-quality, stable, and secure plugins for the community.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Our Philosophy & Community Engagement

This is, first and foremost, a **passion project**, and all plugins are provided **completely free of charge** to the community.

We strongly believe in the spirit of open-source and giving back to the community. As such, we **do not accept monetary donations** for any of our work. Our goal is to foster a vibrant ecosystem where valuable tools are freely accessible, enabling everyone to enhance their Rust server experience without financial barriers.
